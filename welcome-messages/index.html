<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>On behalf of the University of Medicine and Pharmacy Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, it is my great pleasure to welcome you all to the 27th Annual Meeting of the South East Asia Association for Dental Education to be held in Ho Chi Minh City. We are very honored to host this important traditional event which brings together leaders and experts in dental education of the Region to exchange know how and experience.
Despite the diversity of cultures and the differences in economic growth, dental education in all South East Asian countries shares common objectives of forming practitioners able to demonstrate expertise and professionalism in the delivery of preventive and treatment care to individuals and communities.
The theme of the 27th SEAADE Meeting &#x201C;Dental Education in Asia: One Community, One Vision&#x201D; well reflects the necessity of moving forward and sharing, in the actual context of the imminent implementation of the Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA).
I trust that this will be a memorable forum in dental education and I look forward to meeting you all there.</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,</p>
<p><strong>Associate Professor Tran Diep Tuan</strong></p>

<p>University of Medicine and Pharmacy Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam</p>

<h2>Welcome message from chairperson of the local organizing comittee</h2>
<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>On behalf of the Faculty of Odonto-Stomatology, University of Medicine and Pharmacy at Ho Chi Minh City Vietnam, I would like to express our warmest invitation to all of you to the 27th South East Asia Association for Dental Education (SEAADE) Annual Scientific Meeting held in September 8-9, 2016 at Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.</p>
<p>As you know, dental education in Asia is on its way to global integration, which has confronted dental educators in this field with a great challenge, as how to train a new generation of dental practitioners dotted with proper knowledge, competencies and sound medical ethics, and also how to gain regional and international recognition. As a result, all dental schools began transitioning to define learning outcomesand improving measurements to support the evidence of attainment. Curricula were revised to allow the development of competencies that aligned with the accreditation standards. The theme of this meeting &#x201C;Dental Education in Asia: One Community, One Vision&#x201D; has been chosen to reflect these common endeavors.</p>
<p>The program of this meeting includes Dean forums, seminars, free papers and posters presentation. In addition, there are educational research competition and preventive program competition for presenters, dental students and dental schools.
I truly look forward to seeing all institutional members, colleagues, speakers and dental students at this SEAADE meeting. I trust that we will have a fruitful and enjoyable time together in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, one of dynamic cities in Asia.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p><strong>Associate Professor Ngo Thi Quynh Lan</strong></p>

We are very honored to host this important traditional event which brings together leaders and experts in dental education of the Region to exchange know how and experience.\nDespite the diversity of cultures and the differences in economic growth, dental education in all South East Asian countries shares common objectives of forming practitioners able to demonstrate expertise and professionalism in the delivery of preventive and treatment care to individuals and communities.\nThe theme of the 27th SEAADE Meeting “Dental Education in Asia: One Community, One Vision” well reflects the necessity of moving forward and sharing, in the actual context of the imminent implementation of the Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA).\nI trust that this will be a memorable forum in dental education and I look forward to meeting you all there.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n**Associate Professor Tran Diep Tuan**\n\nPresident,\n\nUniversity of Medicine and Pharmacy Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam\n\n(Honorary Chairman of the Local Organizing Committee)\n\n## Welcome message from chairperson of the local organizing comittee\n\nDear Colleagues,\n\nOn behalf of the Faculty of Odonto-Stomatology, University of Medicine and Pharmacy at Ho Chi Minh City Vietnam, I would like to express our warmest invitation to all of you to the 27th South East Asia Association for Dental Education (SEAADE) Annual Scientific Meeting held in September 8-9, 2016 at Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.\n\nAs you know, dental education in Asia is on its way to global integration, which has confronted dental educators in this field with a great challenge, as how to train a new generation of dental practitioners dotted with proper knowledge, competencies and sound medical ethics, and also how to gain regional and international recognition. As a result, all dental schools began transitioning to define learning outcomesand improving measurements to support the evidence of attainment. Curricula were revised to allow the development of competencies that aligned with the accreditation standards.
