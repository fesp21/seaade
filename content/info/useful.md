With the average temperature is 32 Celsius degree, Ho Chi Minh cityâ€™s summer is charming with warm sunlight.

# Phone Calls & Mobile Phone Services

For international calls, dial the international dialing code (00), country code, area code, and the individual number (Detailed code you can found [here](https://countrycode.org/vietnam)). You can make an international call from your hotel but it is often charge expensive cost, so you should check the price before making transactions.

It is much cheaper if you use local SIM and phone cards; which are available for sale at most convenient stores, hotels, and airports with amount from 22.500 VND (~1USD). There are several mobile networks in Vietnam but the cheapest one is Viettel.

Public transportation in Vietnam is very affordable, so you can travel frequently within the country without spending much money.

However the most convenient transport in Ho Chi Minh city is taxi. There are a few companies operating taxi services but our suggestions for responsible ones are Vinasun taxi (green color). Cost will be paid directly to the driver when arriving your destination. Please pay attention to the "counting clock" in their cars before making payment.

# Tax & Tipping

Value-added tax is levied on most goods and services at a standard rate of 10% and is included in the retail price. Tipping is not customary in Vietnam, but a tip from 22,500 VND (~1 USD) or 60,000 VND (~2.5 USD) is common at restaurants and shops.

The standard household (hotel) electrical supply in Vietnam is 220 volt, 50 Hertz, but you may find that 110 volt, 50 Hertz outlets are still in use in some places.
