# Ben Thanh Market

Ho Chi Minh City’s central market and a must-see when visiting Vietnam’s largest and most boisterous city, Ben Thanh Market is fun at any time of day and well into the night. Early mornings see locals shopping for fresh produce before fashion stalls take centre stage throughout the day, as well as rows of coffee traders, selling a dizzying array of beans. Come nightfall, a night market sets up alongside the main hall, selling clothing, apparel and souvenirs until 23:00, along with interesting pop-up street food stalls. Situated in downtown Ho Chi Minh City, bustling Ben Thanh Market in District 1 is a great place to buy local handicrafts, branded goods, Vietnamese art and other souvenirs.Here, you’ll find eating stalls inside the market where you can get a taste of hawker-style Vietnamese cuisine or simply cool off with a cold drink when the bargaining becomes too much.

# Saigon Square

A wholesale market with some of the best prices in Ho Chi Minh, anyone looking for great bargains should make Saigon Square their first stop. Small stalls are densely packed into this warehouse like space, with products stacked high and sold cheap. T-shirts, shoes, swimwear, luggage, jewellery and textiles are all found in abundance here. Anyone looking for bargains while in Saigon should head to Saigon Square on the corner of Nam Ky Khoi Nghia and Le Loi in District 1. This shopping arcade is packed with stalls on two levels selling fashion, accessories and jewellery – be aware of forgeries though, and remember the old adage that if it seems too good to be true it probably is. Even though it’s always bustling with shoppers, Saigon Square is air conditioned and under cover so it is far more pleasant than shopping in the nearby Ben Thanh Market and it’s generally accepted that prices are far better here.

# Secret Garden Restaurant

Rooftop 135 Pasteur, District 1, HCMC. Opening hours: 8AM - 11PM. A Vietnamese Home-Cooked restaurant is a delightful aesthetic and culinary adventure. Shaded, breezy, with fun colors and eclectic wooden furniture, it was an oasis from the HCMC noontime heat. The food is very nice with fresh ingredients and nice decoration.

# Cu Chi Tunnels

A historic region of the Vietnam/US War that includes innumerable trap doors, specially constructed living areas, storage facilities, weapons factories, field hospitals, command centers and kitchens. Today the remaining tunnels have become a major tourist attraction giving the visitor a unique experience and a feel of what underground life in the US war must have been like.
