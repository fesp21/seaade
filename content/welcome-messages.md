Dear Colleagues,

On behalf of the Faculty of Odonto-Stomatology, University of Medicine and Pharmacy at Ho Chi Minh City Vietnam, I would like to express our warmest invitation to all of you to the 27th South East Asia Association for Dental Education (SEAADE) Annual Scientific Meeting held in September 8-9, 2016 at Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

As you know, dental education in Asia is on its way to global integration, which has confronted dental educators in this field with a great challenge, as how to train a new generation of dental practitioners dotted with proper knowledge, competencies and sound medical ethics, and also how to gain regional and international recognition. As a result, all dental schools began transitioning to define learning outcomesand improving measurements to support the evidence of attainment. Curricula were revised to allow the development of competencies that aligned with the accreditation standards. The theme of this meeting “Dental Education in Asia: One Community, One Vision” has been chosen to reflect these common endeavors.

The program of this meeting includes Dean forums, seminars, free papers and posters presentation. In addition, there are educational research competition and preventive program competition for presenters, dental students and dental schools.
I truly look forward to seeing all institutional members, colleagues, speakers and dental students at this SEAADE meeting. I trust that we will have a fruitful and enjoyable time together in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, one of dynamic cities in Asia.
